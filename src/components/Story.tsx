          <p className="mb-4">
            I began my journey as a high school Spanish and math teacher in the United States.
            But deep down, I knew I was called to something greater. I left the safety of the classroom
            and stepped boldly into the unknown.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Within three years, I built a seven-figure real estate business, completing over 150 deals
            and creating the freedom to live life on my terms. That freedom brought me to Costa Rica,
            where I committed fully to living my dream lifeâ€”building wealth, creating community,
            and guiding men to embody their King energy.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            With 15+ years of transformational leadership training at Landmark Worldwide,
            I've led workshops at international conferences, taught improv comedy and laughter yoga
            across the globe, and developed a system to help men rise into sovereignty, joy, and purpose.
          </p>
          <p className="font-semibold">
            Now, my mission is simple: to awaken Kings. To build a network of men who are powerful,
            present, and committed to leaving a legacy.
